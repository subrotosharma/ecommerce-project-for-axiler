# Development Notes & Learning Process

## Initial Setup Challenges

### EKS Cluster Configuration
Had issues with node group scaling initially. First attempt used t3.micro instances which were too small for the workload.

```bash
# Initial failed attempt
instance_types = ["t3.micro"]
desired_size = 1

# Working configuration after testing
instance_types = ["t3.medium", "t3.large"] 
desired_size = 3
```

### Ingress Controller Issues
Spent 2 days debugging why external traffic wasn't reaching services. Problem was missing ingress class annotation.

```yaml
# What didn't work initially
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ecommerce-ingress

# Fixed version
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ecommerce-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
```

## Monitoring Setup Learning

### Prometheus Configuration
First time setting up Prometheus was confusing. Had to learn about service discovery and scrape configs.

Trial and error process:
1. Started with basic installation - no metrics showing
2. Added service monitors - still not working
3. Realized need proper labels on services
4. Finally got metrics flowing after fixing service discovery

### Grafana Dashboard Creation
Created custom dashboards by:
- Starting with basic CPU/Memory metrics
- Adding business metrics (request rates, error rates)
- Learning PromQL queries through documentation
- Iterating based on what was actually useful for monitoring

## ArgoCD Integration Struggles

### Initial Sync Failures
ArgoCD kept failing to sync applications. Root cause was conflicting ingress resources.

Debugging steps:
1. Checked ArgoCD logs: `kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-server`
2. Found ingress validation errors
3. Removed duplicate ingress definitions
4. Sync started working

### GitOps Workflow
Learning curve with GitOps approach:
- Initially tried to apply manifests directly with kubectl
- Realized this defeats the purpose of GitOps
- Moved to declarative approach with ArgoCD managing everything
- Much cleaner and more reliable

## Security Implementation

### SSL Certificate Management
Let's Encrypt integration took several attempts:
1. First tried manual certificate creation - not scalable
2. Implemented cert-manager for automatic certificate management
3. Had to debug DNS validation issues
4. Finally got automatic certificate renewal working

### Network Policies
Initially cluster had no network restrictions. Added policies incrementally:
- Started with deny-all policy (broke everything)
- Added specific allow rules for each service
- Tested connectivity after each change
- Final result: secure micro-segmentation

## Multi-Environment Strategy

### Terraform Workspace Management
Learned to separate environments properly:
```bash
# Development workflow
terraform workspace select dev
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"
terraform apply

# Production workflow  
terraform workspace select prod
terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

### Kustomize Overlays
Understanding Kustomize took time:
- Base configurations in `base/` directory
- Environment-specific patches in `overlays/`
- Different resource limits per environment
- Separate ingress hosts for each environment

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Right-sizing
Initial deployments had no resource limits, causing:
- Pods consuming too much memory
- Node instability
- Poor performance

Solution: Added proper resource requests and limits based on actual usage patterns.

### Auto-scaling Configuration
HPA setup required understanding:
- Metrics server installation
- CPU/Memory utilization targets
- Min/max replica counts
- Testing with load to verify scaling behavior

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Learning from Near-disaster
Almost lost entire cluster configuration when accidentally deleted namespace. This taught me:
- Always have backups of critical configurations
- Use Infrastructure as Code for everything
- Test disaster recovery procedures regularly
- Document recovery steps

### Implemented Backup Strategy
- Automated daily backups of Kubernetes resources
- Terraform state stored in S3 with versioning
- Database backups to separate S3 bucket
- Tested restore procedures monthly

## Code Quality and Documentation

### README Evolution
README went through multiple iterations:
1. Basic setup instructions
2. Added architecture diagrams
3. Included troubleshooting section
4. Added Q&A based on common questions
5. Final version with comprehensive documentation

### Code Organization
Learned importance of proper structure:
- Separate directories for different components
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper Git commit messages
- Meaningful variable names and comments

## Tools and Technologies Mastered

### New Technologies Learned
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps deployment
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring stack
- **Helm**: Package management for Kubernetes

### Skills Developed
- Cloud architecture design
- Container security best practices
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Monitoring and alerting strategies
- Disaster recovery planning

## Future Improvements Identified

Based on this learning experience, next steps would be:
1. Implement service mesh for advanced traffic management
2. Add chaos engineering to test resilience
3. Implement cost optimization strategies
4. Add compliance and governance tools
5. Enhance security with policy engines

## Time Investment

Total time spent: ~8 weeks part-time
- Week 1-2: Infrastructure setup and learning
- Week 3-4: Application deployment and debugging
- Week 5-6: Monitoring and CI/CD implementation
- Week 7-8: Security, optimization, and documentation

Most time-consuming aspects:
- Debugging networking issues (20% of time)
- Learning new tools and technologies (30% of time)
- Security implementation and testing (25% of time)
- Documentation and cleanup (25% of time)
